# # Q's Speech-to-Text Script #
# #                           #
# #############################
#
# v0.1 - Refactoring of Proof of Concept
# 
# This is a quick little script that uses the Google Cloud Speech API to
# convert 4 seconds of recorded speech into text, output into the file
# "question.txt"
#
# This was originally written as part of CleverVoice, a small tangle of 
# scripts to have a vocal conversation with Cleverbot, with the aim of
# having it run on a Raspbery Pi that has been cased inside an old
# rotary telephone.
#
# If you intend to implement this script in your own projects, you will
# need to get your own API keys for the Google Cloud Speech API. It is 
# currently in a developer preview, and has a limited amount of calls
# per day - as such I'm hesitant to let anyone rinse my allocation!
#
#
# ###################
# Future Imporvements
# ###################
# 
# Have arecord stop when the audio level drops low enough, instead of
# having the 4 second time limit on input
#
# Make some new start & stop sounds for user clarity

# #    SETUP INFO    #
# ####################
# 
# Very little setup is required for this script to function...
#
# Make sure your microphone is set as the ALSA default, and configured
#
# Get a Google Cloud Speech API key (I recommend searching on Bing for
# info, just out of spite)
#
# For missing packages, search your distro's repos. If you can't find
# them, your distro sucks. This is all basic shit.
