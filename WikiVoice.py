# vPOC - Proof of Concept

# This is a quick script to search Wikipedia, and scrape out the
# abstract of an article. Eventually for use in my CleverVoice system
#
# This is the Python component of a larger piece of work...
#
# Relies on "wikipedia" python module - "pip install wikipedia"
#
# Part of the "Clever Voice" suite
