# v0.1 - Refacotring of Proof of Concept
#
# Just a little bit of Python plumbing. It uses my other script StT to 
# get text from some audio speech, pass it to cleverbot, and send the 
# response to festival TtS system.
#
# The end result is an internet chatbot that you can converse with,
# in natural vocal language. Aside from starting the program, everything
# else requires no input from the user, except speaking aloud.
#
# Originally coded for a Raspeberry Pi that had been cased in an old
# rotary phone, so there is always someone to talk to...
